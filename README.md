### When is Easter?
I found this in a maths book. It's an algorithm to compute Which day of the year will Easter Sunday be. And then I decided to make it play music.

### Merge subtitles
I'm learning React.js and this looked like a good opportunity to learn.  
Mix two subtitles into one and display them together.

### API Tester
I'm learning React.js and this looked like a good opportunity to learn.  
I created an API tester (a REST client) with support for History, Custom headers, and other important (and needed!) goodies.
