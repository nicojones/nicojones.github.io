Simple yet powerful PHP framework. [Check the docs](https://nicojones.github.io/Ribosome) for more info.

### When is Easter?
I found this in a maths book. It's an algorithm to compute Which day of the year will Easter Sunday be. And then I decided to make it play music. [Check it here](https://github.com/nicojones/easter)

### Merge subtitles
I'm learning React.js and this looked like a good opportunity to learn.  
Mix two subtitles into one and display them together. [See the repo](https://nicojones.github.io/subtitles/)


### Canvas Experiment - Gravity!
I wanted to learn &lt;canvas&gt; and know what all the hipe around it is about. This is my first project: *bouncing balls* 
[See the repo](https://nicojones.github.io/canvas-pool/)

### Canvas Experiment - Billiard / Pool
I wanted to learn &lt;canvas&gt; and know what all the hipe around it is about. This is my second project: *a game of pool* (still has some minor bugs...)
